In this SQL code, I'm answering questions on a netflix database.

--how many movie titles are in the database?
SELECT director, title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nti
ON np.show_id=nti.show_id;

--when were the most recent movie ot tv shows added to database?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type= 'Movie';

--list all movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT MAX(date_added) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

--who directed the movie 'Bright Star'?
SELECT director 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nti
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np 
ON nti.show_id=np.show_id
WHERE nti.title='Bright Star';

--what is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it released?
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"  
WHERE type='Movie' 
Order BY release_year
LIMIT 1;
